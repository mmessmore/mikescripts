# My random scripts for ~/bin

Universally applicable scripts live in the top level.

OS-based scripts exist in directories named after `uname -s`.

Run `make` to install.

## All the places
  - [tmx](./tmx) makes `tmux` act more like `screen -x`.  I like to be able
    to reattach but independently switch windows.  That lets me have
    two terminals up at the same time and independently flip between
    them, or attach from another host, etc.
  - [bootstrap-chezmoi](./bootstrap-chezmoi.sh) sets up chezmoi

## FreeBSD
[FreeBSD Scripts](./FreeBSD) are stuff for maintaining FreeBSD the way I like
to.
